            <button class="accordion">Lucifer's Hordes early 2021</button>
            <div class="accordionPanel" id="LH">
                <p>Lucifer's Hordes is a rouge-like dungeon crawler. Where you use found weapons and skills to fight off Lucifer's hordes of demons. Developed in Unreal 4, me and 4 fellow class mates designed and developed this game over the course of 3 months. My primary contributions were handling item and enemy spawning, along with handling the weapon the player and enemies wielded. I also created the randomization of the dungeon layout as well as creating a sudo random spawning system for enemies.</p>

            <p>Hello there viewer of this Magnificent web page! My name is Kurtis McCammon and I am a wanna be Game Developer who wants to demistify development for normal consumers.</p>
            <h4>Hobbies? Yes, I have those.</h4>
            <p>In my free time, outside of work and programming, I play a plethora of games and paint minitures. I also dable in 3D modeling and printing though due to time contraints I haven't gotten to do much of that recently.</p>
            <h4>Did you make this site?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Yes, I did make this website. It's not great as I don't work on it as much as I want and should. I also am teaching myself how to do it all. CSS is cool, but weird.</p>
